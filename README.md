Chapter 1:

For this chapter, I want you to build a navbar. For simplicity, most of the code has
already been setup for you. Just go to /components/navbar folder, and write the JSX
for creating the navigation links.

There's no right or wrong way of doing it. This is just for practice. You can get the solutions
by checking out branch "chapter-1-answer" to see how it can be done.


Objective: 

Create a list of navigation buttons or links from the state given in component. Be able to render them without error. When clicked on, it should be able to change the route url. That's it!
