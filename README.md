# news-app
It's a fun news app I built to test out new react hooks.

1. clone project -- npm install
2. create api keys from newsapi.org
3. add it to .env file
4. npm run start

WARNING! 
    1. Stupid newsapi.org api_key only works for free for 1 month. Sucks...
    Will need to get new api_key if expired.
    2. API KEY should not be stored in client side. Before deploying live, move to backend.

Expiration for current API key 12/10/2020
